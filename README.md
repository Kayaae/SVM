# SVM
Training projects for SVMs (classification and regression)

Solving the exercises 9 and 10 in Aurélion Géron's book named "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition". 

The tasks are the following: 

1. Train an SVM classifier on the MNIST dataset. Since SVM classifiers are binary classifiers, you will need to use one-versus-the-rest to classify all 10 digits. You may want to tune the hyperparameters using small validation sets to speed up the process. What accuracy can you reach?
2. Train an SVM regressor on the California housing dataset.
