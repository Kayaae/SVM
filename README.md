# Support Vector Machine (SVM) - Learning Projects

This repository includes two SVM projects, one project for SVC (classification) and one project for SVR (regression). Both projects are done using Jupyter Notebook.

## Project 1: Housing Prices - Support Vector Regression (SVR)

Using SVR to predict the median house value per neighbourhood and comparing the results to a regular linear regression.

The project included:
- Preprocessing 
- Trained SVR with RBF and Linear kernels
- Trained a standard linear regression model to compare results
- Feature engineering
- Tuned hyperparameters of SVR model
- Evaluation

## Project 2: MNIST - Support Vector Classification (SVC)

This image classification project focuses on trying to correctly classify images from the MNIST dataset (a dataset of handwritten numbers from 0 to 9).

The project included:
- Trained SVC with Linear, polynomial and RBF kernels
- Data Augmentation
- Tuned hyperparameters
- Evaluation

## Both projects can be viewed in their entireties, including comments and code, at: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Kayaae/SVM/tree/master/
